    <p class="lead">
    <strong>I love abstracting innovative findings and trends on data.
    </strong> My passion is learning and experiencing new tools and contents. During my free time I enjoy exploring new placess, food and

    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My area of focus</strong> is handling the data efieciently to get 
    most from it. I design a complete data life cycle using efficient data tools
    and techniques for better decision making and getting valuable findings and trends.
    I enjoy working on dataset and viewing it from multiple perspectives.
    My first priority has always been to make sure the data is well standardized and preprocessed 
    before analysis avoiding biasnes and wrong results and conclusion.
